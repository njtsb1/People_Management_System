# Developing a people management system in REST API with Spring Boot

In this project we developed a small system for managing people in a company through a REST API, created with Spring Boot.

The following topics will be developed and addressed in this project:

* Initial project setup with Spring Boot Initialzr
* Creation of data model for mapping entities in databases
* Development of user management operations (Registering, reading, updating and removing people from a system).
* Relation of each of the above operations with the REST architectural pattern, and the explanation of each of the REST concepts involved during the development of the project.
* Development of unit tests for functionality validation
* Cloud system deployment through Heroku

To run the project in the terminal, type the following command:

```shell script
mvn spring-boot:run 
```
After executing the above command, just open the following address and view the project execution:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/people
```
# The following prerequisites are necessary for the development and execution of the project:

* Java 11 or higher versions.
* Maven 3.6.3 or higher versions.
